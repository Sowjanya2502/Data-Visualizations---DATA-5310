    "After reading both articles on accessible data visualization by Hampus Seth Forssheim, I gained a deeper understanding of how accessibility extends far beyond just color contrast it encompasses clarity, structure, and inclusive design choices that make visualizations understandable for everyone, including people with color vision deficiencies or those using screen readers. I learned the importance of using multiple visual cues (like texture, shape, or labels) instead of relying solely on color to convey meaning, and how thoughtful design decisions such as providing clear annotations, data summaries, and labels can make charts more inclusive. What surprised me most was how even small design oversights, such as unclear labeling or low contrast in legends, can completely exclude users from understanding a visualization. I tried to maintain good color contrast and include legends in my visualizations but i hadn’t fully thought about how certain color combinations can be indistinguishable for people with color vision deficiencies where multiple colors may appear identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, I plan to follow accessibility guidelines during design, ensuring that visual cues are not color-dependent, and provide contextual descriptions also using different patterns, shapes in addition to color, and labeling the data so my final project visualizations are both informative and inclusive for a diverse audience.\n",

    "The dataset was obtained from the City of Seattle Open Data Portal(https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/Poverty-and-Employment-Status-Seattle-Neighborhood/9f8r-eu9y/about_data). It provides demographic and economic statistics for Seattle neighborhoods based on the American Community Survey (ACS) five-year estimates. The data captures population distributions and poverty measures for residents aged 16 years and older, with a focus on the 20–64 age group. Key variables include population counts for employment status categories such as employed, unemployed, and not in labor force and their corresponding poverty subgroups. It also includes measures like income-to-poverty ratios, families below poverty level, and population in the civilian labor force below poverty. Together, these variables enable analysis of how employment patterns, labor participation, and family structure relate to economic inequality and poverty across different Seattle neighborhoods."
