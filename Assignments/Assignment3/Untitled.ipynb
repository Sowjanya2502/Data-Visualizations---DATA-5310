    "The dataset was obtained from the City of Seattle Open Data Portal(https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/Poverty-and-Employment-Status-Seattle-Neighborhood/9f8r-eu9y/about_data). It provides demographic and economic statistics for Seattle neighborhoods based on the American Community Survey (ACS) five-year estimates. The data captures population distributions and poverty measures for residents aged 16 years and older, with a focus on the 20–64 age group. Key variables include population counts for employment status categories such as employed, unemployed, and not in labor force and their corresponding poverty subgroups. It also includes measures like income-to-poverty ratios, families below poverty level, and population in the civilian labor force below poverty. Together, these variables enable analysis of how employment patterns, labor participation, and family structure relate to economic inequality and poverty across different Seattle neighborhoods."

    "This horizontal bar chart displays the percentage of Seattle’s population in four income-to-poverty categories ranging from deep poverty (< 50%) to above 200% of the poverty line. The bar lengths encode the proportion of residents in each group, while the sequential color scale from brown to green visually represents economic improvement. The chart effectively shows that more than 80 % of Seattle’s population lives above 200 % of the poverty threshold, whereas smaller portions experience deep or near poverty. Its simple quantitative encoding makes the differences between categories immediately clear, although the dominance of the “200 %+” category leaves little visual room to highlight smaller groups. Overall, the graphic effectively summarizes city-wide economic inequality but is more descriptive than exploratory in revealing neighborhood-level variation."

    "This stacked bar chart illustrates how poverty among Seattle’s 20–64-year-old population varies by employment status across different neighborhoods. Each bar represents a neighborhood, and the color segments indicate the proportion of people in poverty belonging to each employment group—employed, unemployed, not in the labor force, and civilian labor force. The visualization effectively highlights how the composition of poverty differs between neighborhoods, showing that in many areas, individuals who are not in the labor force or part of the civilian labor force make up the largest proportions of people below the poverty line, while the unemployed and employed groups represent smaller shares. The color contrast and normalized scale make these comparisons intuitive and visually engaging. However, the exact proportions are difficult to read directly from the chart without the aid of tooltips or annotations. Overall, the plot effectively conveys relative differences across neighborhoods but is less precise for interpreting exact percentage values."

    "In this first iteration, I added sorting to arrange the bar chart, which shows the percentage of the population with income below 200% of the poverty line across different neighborhood subtypes, in descending order. This makes it easier for viewers to quickly identify which neighborhoods have the highest and lowest proportions of residents with lower income levels. However, the visualization needs refinement the y-axis labels should be formatted as percentages to clearly represent the metric being measured. The current aspect ratio of the plot is slightly narrow, which compresses the bars and reduces readability; increasing the chart’s width would improve visual balance and make the differences between neighborhoods easier to interpret."

    "In this iteration, I added an axis format to display the y-axis values as percentages and adjusted the chart’s width and height properties to improve readability and visual balance. These changes make the scale clearer and ensure the bars are easier to compare across neighborhoods. However, the visualization still needs refinement—using a consistent color for all bars would reduce visual distraction, and adding value labels directly on each bar would make it easier to interpret exact percentage values without relying on tooltips. These adjustments would enhance both the clarity and precision of the visualization."

    "In this iteration, I refined the chart by changing all bars to the same color and adding percentage value labels above each bar for better readability. Using a single color removes unnecessary categorical emphasis and helps viewers focus on comparing bar lengths rather than color differences. The addition of direct value labels makes it easier to interpret exact percentages without relying on tooltips, improving the chart’s precision and accessibility. The consistent formatting and balanced aspect ratio make the visualization clearer and more professional. However, the chart still lacks contextual reference such as how these neighborhood-level percentages compare to the overall city average which could be added in the next iteration through a reference line to provide broader interpretive context."

    "In this iteration, I added a citywide reference line to provide contextual comparison and help viewers interpret how each neighborhood subtype’s percentage of residents with income below 200% of the poverty line compares to the overall city average. The dashed black line indicating the average serves as a clear visual benchmark, allowing for quick identification of neighborhoods performing above or below the citywide level. I also constrained the y-axis scale to a fixed range (0–40%) to maintain consistency and prevent exaggerated differences between neighborhoods. These changes make the chart more informative and balanced by grounding neighborhood-level data within a broader context. The next refinement will involve adding a diverging color scale."
